In the Hardware video discussing CPU and ALU, CPU is the central processing unit, control unit.  It recieves instructions from the RAM memory unity.  Which generally moves thru 
numerical comands in order however if instructed can jump around instructions.  Hence the Random part of the RAM.  The CPU then instructs the ALU or the Arithmatic Logic Unit
to preform the math equations then send those results to via output.  The instructions sets include:  Load, Add, Store, Compare, Jump, Jump if, Out and In.
