Truth tables are the possible outcomes of a combination of 1's and O's.  1 = Truth or ON and 2 = False or OFF.  By finding your combination on the table you can see what the 
outcome of the wire would be.  "AND" is the combination of 1 and 2.  If both and a 1 then the outcome is a 1.  If any of the code is a 0, then the outcome is a zero.  With 'OR', 
as long as a code is a 1, then the outcome becomes a 1.  The only way it is a 0, is if both digits are a 0.
